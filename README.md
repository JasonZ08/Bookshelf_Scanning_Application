# Bookshelf Scanning Application

The Bookshelf Scanning Application is a program used to help people of all ages 
determine what book they may want on a bookshelf. This program takes a picture 
of a bookshelf, identifies each individual spine of the books, and figures out
the title of the book based on the spine. The program then performs a search 
to obtain more information about the book, including the ISBN number, the 
total number of pages, and a description.
